## Inspiration

It starts from a conversation we had with one of our members, who is an avid movie fan, particularly on Netflix. Speaking with them, sparked a realization that films most commonly recommended are either classics or made by well-known production companies. This led us to contemplate the underrepresentation in the entertainment industry, not only in terms of on-screen representation but also in terms of the hardworking individuals behind the scenes such as directors and producers.

With the abundance of film options available today, it can be challenging to find and appreciate truly exceptional movies. Many people base their film choices on the popularity of a specific actor/actress or whether a movie is currently trending. To address this issue, we aim to create a platform that highlights great films for their artistic and technical excellence, rather than just their mainstream appeal.

## What it does

RoseFlix is a website that helps users discover films that highlight underrepresentation in the entertainment industry. Users can search for films based on specific topics of interest, such as films _directed by women_ or films _featuring female empowerment_. Once films are displayed from the search, users can click on a film of interest and watch its trailer to determine if it is a movie that interests them.

By offering a platform for users to explore films that may not have mainstream appeal, RoseFlix aims to give underrepresented voices in the film industry the opportunity to be heard.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
